    <h2> Description</h2>
<p> Bringing ramen home takes a trip to an Asian market, 
    three days of work, and your largest pot, but this 
    low-stress (really!) labor of love might be the best soup 
    you'll ever make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces dried kombu</li> 
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. dry sake</li>

        <li>1 lb.pork spare ribs</li>
        <li>2 bunchless scallions chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeeled, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, halved horizontally</li>
        <li>1 1" piece of ginger, peeled, sliced </li>
        <li>1/4 cup bonito flakes </li>
        <li>3 large eggs </li>
        <li>6 5-oz. packages fresh thing and wavy ramen noodles </li>
        <li>1/2 cup menmo</li>
        <li>6 scallions </li>
        <li>3 thinly sliced toasted nori sheets, torn in half</li>
        <li>Chili oil, toasted sesame oil, and schichimi togarashi</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol> 
            <li>Two days ahead: For the dashi, combine kombu and 4 quarts cold water in a large bowl. <br>
             Cover and let sit at room temperature at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours.<br>
             For the tare, combine soy sauce, sake, and mirin in a small bowl; cover and chill.</li>
            <li>One day ahead: Season pork shoulder with salt and pepper.
                 Roll up and tie with kitchen twine at 2” intervals. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large heavy pot (at least 8 quarts) over medium-high heat. <br>
                     Cook pork shoulder, turning, until brown all over, 10–12 minutes. <br>
                    Add chicken, spareribs, scallions, carrots, garlic, ginger, and bonito flakes. <br>
                     Remove kombu from dashi; discard. Add as much kombu dashi as will fit in pot once <br> liquid is boiling (reserve remaining dashi). 
                    Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, skimming the surface occasionally <br>
                     and adding remaining dashi as liquid reduces, until pork shoulder is tender and stock has <br>
                      reduced to about 2 quarts, 2½–3 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove pork shoulder from stock and let cool. Wrap tightly in plastic and chill <br>
                 until ready to use.Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into another large pot<br>
                  or a large bowl or container; discard solids. Cover and chill.</li>        
            <li> Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Carefully add eggs one at a time and boil gently <br>
                 for 7 minutes. Drain eggs and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop cooking; <br>
                  let cool. Peel; set aside.</li> 
            <li>Remove string and thinly slice pork; cover and set aside.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, bring stock to a simmer; it should be very hot. <br>
                 At the same time, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water according <br> 
                 to package directions until al dente; drain (no need to salt the water, as ramen noodles contain more salt than pasta).</li>
            <li>Just before serving, divide noodles among 6 deep bowls. <br>
                 Top with sliced pork, placing it off to one side. Add tare to hot stock and ladle <br>
                  over pork to warm through (stock should come up just to the level of the noodles).</li>
            <li>Place a small pile of menma next to pork. <br>
                 Halve eggs and place next to menma. Place a small pile of sliced scallions next to egg. <br>
                  Tuck half a sheet of nori between side of bowl and noodles so it’s just poking out.</li>
            <li>Serve ramen with chili oil, sesame oil, and shichimi togarashi.</li>
         </ol>
